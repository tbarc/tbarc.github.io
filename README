This is a personal website in which I will store my programming portfolio,
containing personal and academic projects.

I will make posts updating progress on personal projects, such as Togethr.
Togethr is a social networking application centered around spontaneous
human connection, with the goal of connecting people with shared interests.

Eventually, I will create a devblog separate from this website for the dev
progress on Togethr and weekly(?) updates. 

First and foremost, this is a tech blog and I will write blog posts about
current tech, large trends, and specific interests such as Tesla's autopilot
and Google's Pixel.

I will gradually find a central focus that my blog can center around.
