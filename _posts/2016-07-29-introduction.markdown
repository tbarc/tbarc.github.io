title: Welcome to my Blog!

Hello, and welcome to my first post. My name is Tyler Bugbee and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Georgia. I hope to use this website as an outlet for tech-talk, information on what I'm working on in school and otherwise, and other curiosities as they relate to computer science.

My current interests are machine learning, predictive analytics, large-scale data problems, and parallel and distributed computing.

You can find me at [GitHub](https://github.com/tbarc), [LinkedIn](Public Profilehttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerbugbee), and [Gmail](mailto:tbugbee1@gmail.com). Feel free to contact me directly!
